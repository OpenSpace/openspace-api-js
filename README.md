# openspace-api-js
JavaScript library to interface with [OpenSpace](https://github.com/OpenSpace/OpenSpace) using sockets and WebSockets.

## Work in progress
Both the API and libary are still very much work in progress, and are subject to change.

## Documentation

A [reference](https://openspace.github.io/openspace-api-js) can be found here. Examples are available below:

### NodeJS in the terminal
https://github.com/OpenSpace/openspace-api-js/blob/master/examples/example.js provides an example of how to connect from a NodeJS. To run it, run `npm example.js` in a terminal.

### Simple website
https://github.com/OpenSpace/openspace-api-js/blob/master/examples/index.html provides an example of connecting to OpenSpace from a website. For simplicity, the example is self-contained in the index.html file.

### Web application
For a proper example of how to interact with OpenSpace from a web application using npm, webpack and modern ES versions, please refer to https://github.com/OpenSpace/openspace-api-web-example.


### Observable Notebook
Use Obserable notebooks to interact with OpenSpace locally:

This may be useful for tinkering, GUI prototyping and testing the lua interface during development.
